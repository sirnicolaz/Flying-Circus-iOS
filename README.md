Monty Python's Flying Circus TV for iOS
=======================================

Introduction
-------------

This application offers a fancy interface to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes in srtreaming from YouTube.
The idea arised from a need of tributing my favourite TV series.

In the App Store http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monty-pythons-flying-circus/id502889243?mt=8
The Website http://www.flyingcircusplayer.com

UPDATE: The app has been removed from the store. After a long discussion with the Python (Monty) Pictures Limited producer,
	John Goldstone,	I had to give app. Apparently, the problem is that this app "create confusion, thanks to the nature of
	search engines", as soon as the official Flying Circus app will be released. 
	Even proposing a new version working with original episodes (purchasable from iTunes), the
	agreement has not been reached.
	You can get the app by compiling the code, if you like it. Twitter sharing is still an experimental feature.
	
	So long, and thanks for the fish.
